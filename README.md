# RECOGNITION OF ETHIOPIAN HERBACEOUS PLANTS USING A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
####     Authors: Derso Mekuriaw, Nega Agmas, and Solomon Alebachew
### Dataset Details
<p style='text-aign: justify'>Up to now for herb detection and recognition there is no renowned dataset but there
exist some datasets provided by several researchers like Flavia dataset (Stephen, et al.,
Dec. 2007). However, the currently available datasets are not useful for this research
because we donâ€™t know whether they are herbaceous or not. So, for building the Ethio-Herb model and evaluating its performance, we have executed the proposed model on a huge number of real-world images collected and/or captured by ourselves. Such
medical plants are found in different natural ecosystems of the forests, grasslands,
woodlands, wetlands, in field margins and garden fences, as weeds and in many other
microhabitats. In order to have an image of such medical/herbaceous
plants the role of domain experts and our knowledge of these medical
plants are very high. Some of the experts showed us the herbaceous plants in the real
environment, and the others told us where and when these plants are available by
including their medical properties. Tecno Camon CX mobile phone with a camera
resolution of 4608 x 3456 pixel are used for data collection with the following
parameter.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Without using camera stands or tripods to reduce shaking of hands.</li>
  <li>The distance between the images and the camera are not constant.</li>
  <li>Most of the images are taken with a relatively white background and in the same controlled environment in order to avoid external effects of sunlight and other environmental conditions.</li>
  <li>All the images are in JPEG (Joint Photographer Expert Group) file format.</li>
</ul>
